# Poker
The goal of this project is to develop a poker AI that can play an exploitative and/or a game theory optimal (GTO) strategy. 
The first portion of the project is the development of the game of poker, first as a command line application, but later with a functioning web frontend using React.
I plan to use RL with Counterfactual Regret Minimization for the GTO AI, and potentially train a neural net based on hand history that can update and improve the strategy exploitatively as the AI plays an opponent.
